# flow bug

1. `yarn`
2. `yarn flow`

Actual: `No errors!`

Expected: ``DoesNotExist: Property not found in 'exports of `react`'`` and `React. Could not resolve name`.

Note that [eslint-plugin-flowtype-errors](https://github.com/amilajack/eslint-plugin-flowtype-errors) somehow runs `flow` in some way that _does_ show an error for the `DoesNotExist` case:

```
$ yarn eslint
/home/lydell/bugs/flow/flow-typed/foobar.js
  6:45  error  DoesNotExist: Property not found in 'exports of `react`'. See line 3  flowtype-errors/show-errors

âœ– 1 problem (1 error, 0 warnings)
```

Also note that `React` being undefined _is_ reported in [Try Flow](https://flow.org/try/#0PQKgBAAgZgNg9gdzCYAoVxhgJIDsAuApgQJZy4CGMMAnmAERRwBOA5nPkbvQHQZYkAtgAcW+ZGAoBnMACVCFAMbiozOIIbMFy+gG50UAK65lZXGCJT8ACgCUALjnb8PAKIxCg4vgDC5KCSsADwAfGAA3gC+6EA).
